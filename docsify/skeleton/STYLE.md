## Style Guide

### HTML
Docsify and some Markdown viewers supports mixing HTML and Markdown elements in the same document. There must be a blank line between the two formats.
```
<center>

  ![](../img/goals.png)

</center>
```
Note the blank line between the `<center>` HTML tag and the `![](../img/goals.png)` Markdown tag.
